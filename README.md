# How to test the projects

These projects are developed separately for the frontend server and backend server.

There is a README.md in the react_gui folder.

For convenience, whoever wants to test the projects locally could download the project, and

Run `npm start` in the folder react_gui and run `dotnet run --launch-profile https` in the utilsApi folder.

It should activate both servers separately. 

If anyone wants to fetch the API from the API server, the backend server should be activated before any call.
